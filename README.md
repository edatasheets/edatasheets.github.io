## Background
### 1 Introduction 
As the demand for hardware design automation tools increases, there is a need for machine readable datasheets. 
Defining a common digital datasheet specification reduces the burden for component vendors to deliver multiple datasheets to support different tools and encourages reuse of tools across multiple designs. 

#### 1.1 Objectives
Part manufacturers create datasheets to document component information including performance, electrical characteristics, size, orientation, packaging, etc. Digital datasheets contain this information in a machine readable format.The objective of this specification is to create a uniform, machine-readable format for representing component datasheets.

#### 1.2 Scope
This document is intended for digital datasheet producers such as components vendors as well as people who will consume these digital datasheets to automate designs such as tool creators.The specification will include common classes of components used in designs. Some examples are included in the appendices to provide context for future additions to this specification.

#### 1.3 Keywords
- Required: The field is required in the component digital datasheet.
- Optional: The field may or may not be included in the component digital datasheet.
- Shall: Indicates a mandatory requirement.
- May: Indicates an optional requirement.
