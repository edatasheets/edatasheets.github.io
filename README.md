## Background
### 1 Introduction 
As the demand for hardware design automation tools increases, there is a need for machine readable datasheets. 
Defining a common digital datasheet specification reduces the burden for component vendors to deliver multiple datasheets to support different tools and encourages reuse of tools across multiple designs. 

#### 1.1 Objectives
Part manufacturers create datasheets to document component information including performance, electrical characteristics, size, orientation, packaging, etc. Digital datasheets contain this information in a machine readable format.The objective of this specification is to create a uniform, machine-readable format for representing component datasheets.

#### 1.2 Scope
This document is intended for digital datasheet producers such as components vendors as well as people who will consume these digital datasheets to automate designs such as tool creators.The specification will include common classes of components used in designs. Some examples are included in the appendices to provide context for future additions to this specification.

#### 1.3 Keywords
Required: The field is required in the component digital datasheet.
Optional: The field may or may not be included in the component digital datasheet.
Shall: Indicates a mandatory requirement.
May: Indicates an optional requirement.

### 2. Use Cases 
Digital datasheets can be used for many applications. The list of use cases included here is not meant to be exhaustive and it is expected that new applications will be developed as more people start using these digital datasheets. Sample applications include automated hardware design checks to identify bugs earlier in the design cycle, automated hardware designs to speed up board development, components comparison to identify replacement components on a design.
